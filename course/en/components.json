REBBA requires a broker of record to be actively involved in the day-to-day operations of the brokerage. A salesperson’s interactions with a broker of record will vary depending on many aspects of the brokerage, including:</span><br><div class=''><span tabindex='0' class='d-flex'><span>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>The number of offices for the brokerage – for example, a brokerage with one office will have all employees in the same location.

At all times, you should know that guidance and advice will be provided to you at any stage of a transaction. Regardless of the brokerage structure, all brokers and salespersons are to be provided active supervision, management and support, no matter what the depth of experience the individual has.</span>","_pageLevelProgress":{"_isEnabled":true}},{"_id":"c-51","_parentId":"b-72","_type":"component","_component":"text","_classes":"text-padding","intro":true,"_layout":"full","title":"","displayTitle":"Salesperson Interactions with Sellers and Buyers","displayimage":"course/en/images/c2_m0_prr_00_01_08_01.jpg","displayalttext":"The background image shows a salesperson interacting with a couple outside a house.","body":"<span tabindex='0'>A brokerage is authorized under REBBA to trade in real estate on behalf of consumers. All brokers and salespersons are employees of the brokerage, and therefore, by extension of the authority granted to a brokerage to trade in real estate, are authorized to trade on behalf of a brokerage. As such, any agreement with a seller or a buyer is made with the brokerage, and not the individual broker or salesperson.</span></br></br><span tabindex='0'>Sellers and buyers, when choosing who they will work with during a real estate transaction, will base their decision on many factors; one of which is the brokerage and the brokerage’s reputation and prominence in the marketplace. A salesperson should understand the importance of the image a brokerage portrays. However, when the actual interactions occur between a seller or a buyer and a brokerage, it is you, as the individual salesperson, who is their point of contact. Sellers and buyers may mistakenly think they are hiring a specific individual to sell their home or show them properties. In fact, they are hiring the brokerage, and any broker or salesperson employed by that brokerage is obligated to that seller or buyer as much as the specific salesperson.</span></br></br> <span tabindex='0'>When working directly with sellers and buyers, a brokerage will provide you, as a salesperson, with the authority to sign certain documents on its behalf. For example, when a listing is obtained, the listing agreement will identify the brokerage as a party to the agreement, and you would sign that agreement on the brokerage’s behalf.</span></br></br><span tabindex='0'>Sellers and buyers will commonly refer to a salesperson as their “real estate agent”. This is a term that is commonly heard and used, but it is inaccurate. As the brokerage is authorized to trade in real estate on behalf of others, the brokerage is the agent. You will not be a real estate agent; you will be a salesperson – something that is misunderstood by consumers, the media, and others – and now, no longer misunderstood by you!

These fees will vary from brokerage to brokerage, and could include expenses such as advertising, training sessions, and administration fees related to processing a trade.</span></br></br><span tabindex='0'>Commission sharing is the distribution methods used when a commission is paid to the brokerage and it is to be disbursed to the applicable parties. Commission is allocated between the two sides of a transaction. The listing side represents the brokerage and salesperson working with the seller, while the selling side represents the brokerage and salesperson working with the buyer. Once the listing and selling portions of the gross commission are identified, there is a subsequent allocation between the brokerage and the salesperson(s). When two brokerages are involved in a transaction, the brokerages are referred to as the listing brokerage (working with the seller) and the co-operating brokerage (working with the buyer).</span></br></br><span tabindex='0'>When commission is shared between the brokerage and the salesperson, there are many ways in which this sharing of commission can be calculated. Typically, the percentage paid to the salesperson will be higher than the percentage retained by the brokerage as a salesperson is likely to be responsible for paying their own expenses related to the sale. For example, a salesperson could contract for a 75/25 share – the salesperson receives 75% of the commission while the brokerage retains 25% of the commission.</span></br></br><div class=''><span tabindex='0'><b>Common commission sharing methods include:</b></span></br><span tabindex='0' class='d-flex'><span>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>A yearly plan with an increasing percentage share to the salesperson as higher levels of production are achieved.</span></span><span tabindex='0' class='d-flex'><span>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>An annual percentage based on a higher share being paid to the salesperson, but the brokerage will require a larger contribution towards specified expenses.</span></span><span tabindex='0' class='d-flex'><span>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>An annual percentage based on a higher share being paid to the salesperson, but the brokerage will require an established monthly desk fee to be paid by the salesperson.
